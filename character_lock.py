"""Deterministic character-lock for the video pipeline.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
"Character mismatch" happens when a scene resolves to 0 characters (it then
falls back to the source video's style frames as the only human reference, so
the model borrows whoever was in the sample video) OR when the same name maps
to different sheets across scenes because matching is done ad-hoc per scene.

This module resolves character identity ONCE per render into a locked index, so:
  * every named/roled character resolves to exactly one sheet,
  * the SAME name always resolves to the SAME sheet for the whole video,
  * unresolved scenes are logged loudly instead of degrading silently.

It is intentionally standalone (imports only stdlib + pipeline for the role
alias helper) so it can be wired into the existing pipeline without touching
any current code. See TRACKING.md for the one-time integration.
